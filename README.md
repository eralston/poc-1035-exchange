# 1035 Exchange Front-End Prototype
This was developed with [bolt.net](https://bolt.new/) and [a hosted demo is live NOW right HERE](https://moonlit-sunshine-3e45f7.netlify.app/).

This is an example of how to work with AI-powered rapid prototyping tools, including how to organize work using markdown files in the project. README.md, PRD.md, Design.md, Data.md, and Plan.md are each generated as intermediary content to guide the process.

# 1035 Exchange Workflow Management System

A comprehensive SaaS platform designed to streamline the IRS Section 1035 exchange process for insurance companies, focusing on the workflow executed by the receiving company. This application transforms the traditionally fragmented, manual process into a secure, trackable, and efficient digital workflow.

## üéØ Overview

The 1035 Exchange Workflow Management System is a single-tenant application built for internal use by receiving insurance companies to manage the complete lifecycle of tax-deferred transfers between life insurance and annuity contracts. The platform provides real-time collaboration, comprehensive audit trails, and seamless integration capabilities.

### Key Value Propositions
- **Speed**: Reduce exchange cycle times by 50%+
- **Accuracy**: Lower NIGO (Not In Good Order) rates through structured workflows
- **Trust**: Secure collaboration across institutional boundaries
- **Compliance**: Built-in documentation for regulatory peace of mind

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Domain Model

The application follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with event-driven architecture, organized into five core domains:

### 1. DropTicket Domain
**Root Aggregate** - Represents the complete 1035 exchange request lifecycle
- **Entities**: DropTicket, Owner, Insured, Agent, StatusTimeline
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Accept new drop ticket submissions
  - Coordinate validation for multiple source policies
  - Track progress independently per policy
  - Fan-in event handling for transfer confirmations

### 2. Policy Domain
**Individual Policy Management** - Handles source and target policy validation and tracking
- **Entities**: Policy, PolicyType, Carrier, PolicyStatus
- **Capabilities**:
  - Validate policy eligibility under ¬ß1035 IRS rules
  - Generate policy-level communication requests
  - Track status progression (Validated ‚Üí Awaiting Carrier ‚Üí Confirmed)

### 3. CarrierCommunication Domain
**External Integration Layer** - Manages all carrier interactions
- **Entities**: CarrierRequest, CarrierResponse, CommunicationChannel
- **Capabilities**:
  - Multi-channel communication (email, API, fax)
  - SLA monitoring and escalation
  - Retry logic and delivery confirmation
  - Webhook handling for carrier responses

### 4. ExchangeLifecycle Domain
**Orchestration & Analytics** - Provides system-wide coordination and metrics
- **Entities**: ExchangeState, LifecycleEvent, MetricsSnapshot
- **Capabilities**:
  - Aggregate lifecycle metrics
  - State transition management
  - Real-time analytics and reporting
  - Notification triggers

### 5. Audit & Exception Domain
**Compliance & Governance** - Ensures full auditability and manual intervention capabilities
- **Entities**: AuditLogEntry, OverrideAction, Justification
- **Capabilities**:
  - Complete audit trail logging
  - Manual override with justification
  - Exception handling and escalation
  - Compliance reporting
